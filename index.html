To,
Mr. Naveen Patnaik,
Honorable Chief Minister,
Government of Odisha, Bhubaneswar


Subject: Government College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar (CETB) status as a Unitary University as “Odisha Technological University, Bhubaneswar (OTUB)” (Website: http://www.cet.edu.in)


Respected Sir,


As you must be aware that CETB attracts best talents from across the length & breadth of Odisha through the competitive joint entrance examinations. Only meritorious and deserving talents who are really keen to pursue the field of Engineering, are chosen amongst the thousands of applicants.


We, the current and past students of Government College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar (CETB), take this opportunity to remember the great son of Odisha “Biju Babu”. During his chief ministership during 1990s, our Biju Babu had envisioned to make CETB (which was under OUAT that was established again by Biju Babu) a world class institute at par with IIT. However, in 2016 if we observe, CETB has been forced downwards in last decade to an extent that it is clubbed through BPUT among 100s of private Engineering Colleges of Odisha, which have no performance standing of their own. Every year, the gifted students of CETB, who are the toppers of JEE, graduate from CETB unceremoniously. A complete de-recognition of the brightest talents of Odisha takes place very year. Thus, we would seek your attention to the College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar (CETB), a Premier Institution of Higher Learning in the state, and your favorable consideration in upgrading CET Bhubaneswar to an institute of national repute.


Considering the outstanding merit, the question parents, students and alumni are asking are the following:

- If their talent is being provided justice and a fair platform vis-a-vis thousands of engineering students in Odisha, who have just joined ANY private engineering college by paying a hefty donation fees?
- Whether their talent is being nurtured well by the state to retain their competitive spirit and enthusiasm to excel in the national level?
- It is high time Odisha needs to rise from being a state that churns out thousands of engineers, who are non-employable (as per Industry statistics) to the state that can generate Nadellas / Vishal Sikkas or Sundar Pichais of the modern technical world. The institution that is nearest to achieving this is the one which has access to top talent in the state, v.i.z., CET Bhubaneswar.

With over 7000 illustrious alumni from across 35 batches, CETB has the broadest footprint across the globe. Its alumni have earned stripes for themselves and the organizations they represent - as distinguished faculty at Top Universities, or Senior executives of Multi-Nationals, or Navaratna or Maharatna companies, and co-founders of start-ups. Rightfully, CETB deserves to be recognized for its achievements, and merits a Unitary University status to carry forward the distinguishing service to the state. We submit the following facts of CETB for your favorable consideration.


Why CET Bhubaneswar should be a Unitary University as OTUB?
1. It is one of the oldest Govt. engineering colleges of the state, with a history spanning over 33 years
2. It has the unique advantage as the only Govt. engineering college in the state capital Bhubaneswar
3. It has highest number of Under-Graduate disciplines (11). The yearly student intake close to 900 which is a large number to make it a Unitary University.
4. Offering over 350 seats across 18 specializations for M.Tech., CETB has already built a brand as a Center of Excellence for research and learning in Technological domains.
5. 150 faculty member positions with most faculties having Ph.D.
6. Notable/Significant Alumni from CETB over the years (For example, Faculty positions in US, Faculties in IITs, Scientists in national labs, CEOs in MNCs, High level managers of Multinational Companies). Selected Examples:

- Prof./Dr. Saraju Mohanty, Professor, Texas USA
- Prof./Dr. Santanu Mishra, Professor, IIT-Kanpur
- Prof./Dr. Bijay Panigrahi, Associate Professor, IIT-Delhi
- Prof./Dr. Debabrata Das, Professor and Dean, IIIT Bangalore
- Dr. Mahendra Samal, Scientist G, BARC, Mumbai
- Mr. Manoj Swain, CEO, Morgan Stanley, Hong Kong
- Mr. Roshan Subuddhi, VP, Cognizant
- Mr. Pramod Panda, VP, Infosys
- Mr. Niloy Sanyal, CMO, GE Software
- Mr. Debabrata Dash, HR Head, Tata Steel
- Mrs. Sona Mohapatra, Showcase Odisha Award winner, 2014
- Dr. Malaya Pradhan, Deputy Director, Factories and Boilers

7. CETB has the one of the best placement statistics among the engineering colleges in the State of Odisha. Almost 100% placement has been achieved in the last few years. The major employers include core engineering companies as well as IT companies. E.g. - Tata Steel, Jindal Steel, Adani Power, Infosys, Wipro, TCS.
8. Research productive of the faculty and student of CETB matches and even far exceeds other recently declared Engineering/Technological Universities like IIIT Bhubaneswar and VSSUT, Burla, of the State of Odisha.
9. The educational infrastructure is one of the best, which include computing facility, internet facility and library facility.
10. It is well connected by rail and air with all corners of globe so collaboration and research sharing facility can enhance.


We believe the following are specific benefits of a Unitary University Status of CETB under name OTUB:
1. The university can take its own decisions in all respects i.e. academic, administration and financial matters for which now college is depending on BPUT. BPUT is over burdened with the problems of all the 101 affiliated colleges of the state.
2. New advanced and industry oriented courses & research facilities can be introduced; the best students of the state are taking admission in this college, but they are suffering a lot in respect of timely examination, result declaration, getting certificate, no fixed academic calendar, etc. All these problems can be resolved once it is upgraded to University status.
3. Lot of administrative problems remain unaddressed due to time constraints and overburdened BPUT authority. Those can be addressed properly, which will improve the work environment and focus can be shifted on CET Bhubaneswar specifically.
4. Once it becomes a university, it will be eligible to get funds from UGC and easy to get research projects from different funding agencies by which the infrastructure and laboratory facilities will be enhanced a lot by which the students will able to work in cutting edge technologies.
5. The college has got fund from TEQIP-II with undertaking that it will be upgraded to Autonomous Institution shortly, but it has not been fulfilled. Govt of India is now planning to extend that to TEQIP-III, which will make CET ineligible to receive the fund further.
6. Recently under Rastriya Uchhatar Sikhya Abhijan (RUSA), CET Bhubaneswar is not eligible to get funds whereas only BPUT and VSSUT will get funds.
7. CET attracts highest quality students from JEE. But these students are lost among 40,000 students of the affiliated colleges. They are not recognized for their talent and hard work. This is gross unfair to the students as well as to their parents. Being in a unitary university, they will achieve unique identity.
8. Academics quality is severely affected as there is a mismatch between industry demand and course curriculum
9. Syllabus of the college is not updated to match the technological advancements in the global arena.
10. CETB is not able to further advance its research via international collaborations which the unitary university status will help.
11. CETB faculty are deprived of national level UGC driven Raman Research Fellowship.  Unitary university status will facilitate such fellowship
12. Autonomy to pursue research, and incubation of specific technological and business innovations


Present status regarding proposal of upgrading CETB to a Unitary University under OTUB:

We learnt from published media in a meeting under chairmanship of our Hon'ble Minister of Employment & Technical Education & Training (ET& ET) Department, Govt. of Odisha Sj, Sanjaya Dasverma, a decision was made to upgrade both IGIT Sarang and CET Bhubaneswar into Unitary University. Accordingly, with the approval of Hon'ble Chief Minister Sri Naveen Patnaik, the Govt. formed a four-member committee to study the proposal and give a feasibility report regarding upgrading CET to Unitary University. The four-member committee already submitted their report along with a draft bill of upgrading CETB into Unitary University to Govt. But no further progress has been made on this matter till date.


When we look at some of the recently formed university in Odisha, CET stands quite favorably to be granted unitary university status.


Name of the Institutes	Year of      	Year declared	Time Span
in State of Odisha		Establishment	as University

Centurion University 	2005				2010		5 Years

KIIT University 		1997				2004		7 years

IIIT Bhubaneswar		2006				2014		8 Years

SOA University			1996				2007		11 Years

XIMB University			1997				2013		16 Years

CET, Bhubaneswar		1981				Not Yet		35 Years


We, the current students and alumni thus request a fast track conversion of CETB to Unitary University “Odisha Technological University, Bhubaneswar (OTUB)”.


Sincerely,


Current Students, CETB

Alumni, CETB
